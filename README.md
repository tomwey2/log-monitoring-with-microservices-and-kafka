## Introduction
This showcase shows conceptual how log data can be analysed and monitored that are generated by
hardware and software components, e.g. network, operating systems,
applications, and servers. The following technology stack is used:

- Microservices based on Spring Boot Cloud
- Apache Kafka as a distributed event streaming platform
- MongoDB to store the analysed log data
- Grafana dashboard visualizes the data from the database
- Docker to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers
